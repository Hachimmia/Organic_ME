# Organic_ME

Organic ME is my first project in the HND web development course at Edinburgh College in 2022.

It is about creating a website for a caf√© in the Scottish Borders. 
I made all the graphics in the background, logo, and code part.

For building this project I used:

- HTML
- SASS
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- npm

Software:

- Visual Studio Code
- Adobe XD
- Adobe Illustrator
- Adobe Photoshop
